## Background
In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

- Advantages of refactoring code
Refactoring and cleaning up the code can catch duplicated subroutines, unnecessary loops, redundant statements, it also can run faster and more efficiently, improve the quality.

- Disadvantages of refactoring code
Programming can have multiple approaches to a solve a problem. It can be risky refracting a stable code to apply a different set of logic could be costly or introduce new bugs into the system. When juggling tight deadlines, programmers may also have to choose between refactoring or developing new code.
